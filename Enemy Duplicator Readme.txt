Hey! First of all thanks for downloading the mod.





------------------- READ THIS ENTIRE README. IT HAS ALL THE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS MOD -------------------

INSTALLATION:

1. Use UnpackDarkSoulsForModding (https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1304) in order to unpack your game. It is absolutely necessary for this mod or IT WILL NOT WORK.
Why? Because my program basically says "Can I see a 'map' folder?" If the answer is no, then it's brain explodes. Don't let my program's brain explode.

2. Place all files into your dark souls remastered game folder (where the exe is located). 

3. BACK UP YOUR map\MapStudio FOLDER. This exe affects msb map files within that MapStudio folder. 
Not backing up that folder will result in those files being permanently affected UNLESS you entirely delete all of them and verify game files through steam.
Don't do any of that nonsense and instead just backup the dang files!

4. Then, run the exe provided in this zip while it is in your game folder where the DSR exe is located.

5. A command prompt comes up. USE ONLY WHOLE NUMBERS. NOT 7.5, or typing the letter "a". The program can only take whole number integers or else it causes an error.

6. Enjoy and have fun! OH and PLEASE feel free to send me your youtube videos or twitch vods of you playing this mod! I'd love to watch them. My discord is "hungryhyena78".


CHANGING TO A DIFFERENT MULTIPLIER:

This mod ADDS enemies technically. So for example, if you enter a multiplier of 2, it will add one enemy to every existing enemy.
It's just how it works. Don't question it. If you use it AGAIN and want to play with a 3x multiplier, it will ADD 2 ENEMIES. So you'll have
4 total enemies per enemy including the first enemy. (That's a lot of enemies).

Instead, to change from something like 2x to 3x, REPLACE the map\mapstudio folder with the game's ORIGINAL FILES (aka your backup). And in this
process, KEEP your backup.


UNINSTALLING:

1. Replace the map\mapstudio files (msbs) back into your map\mapstudio folder. You're basically taking your vanilla dark souls files
and inserting them back in.

2. Delete any other files from this zip that are in your game folder if you REALLY want to. It's not super necessary honestly.


OTHER INFORMATION:

A lot of shit is broken. Like anything that has an event script attached will not work. For example, skeletons in the graveyard will not wake up because their event
is not linked to the cloned or duplicated enemies. So all bosses basically won't have health bars AS OF YET. I might fix all of this shit at some point. Idk yet but
don't bet on it.
